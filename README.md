# PCB-555-Timer
This is a PCB with a 555 Timer chip on a heart-shaped board. I chose a heart shape design because I think that love takes a lot of trial and error for two people to work together.
The same way it took a lot of trial and error for the PCB to work.

This is a PCB with a 555 Timer with the following components:

555 Timer Cheap

3V Battery

2x 4.7 uF Capacitors

1x 22 kiloOhms Resistor

1x 68 kiloOhms Resistor

1x 470 KilOhms Resistor

1x Red LED


The LED is connected to 470 resistor. The 22kO and 68kO resistor are respectively the first and second resistors along the circuit as seen in the design files, and the pictures below.



The Design folder contains all the kicad files necessary to replicate the design:

We have also have outline svg files for milling:
